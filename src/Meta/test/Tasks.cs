   Creating Tasks Cheat Sheet:
   - Begin with the end in mind. Identify the specific outcome your tasks are aiming to achieve.
   - Break down the outcome into actionable tasks, assigning each task to the appropriate agent.
   - Ensure tasks are descriptive, providing clear instructions and expected deliverables.
   
   Goal:
   - Develop a detailed itinerary, including city selection, attractions, and practical travel advice.
   
   Key Steps for Task Creation:
   1. Identify the Desired Outcome: Define what success looks like for your project.
       - A detailed 7 day travel itenerary.
   
   2. Task Breakdown: Divide the goal into smaller, manageable tasks that agents can execute.
       - Itenerary Planning: develop a detailed plan for each day of the trip.
       - City Selection: Analayze and pick the best cities to visit.
       - Local Tour Guide: Find a local expert to provide insights and recommendations.
   
   3. Assign Tasks to Agents: Match tasks with agents based on their roles and expertise.
   
   4. Task Description Template:
     - Use this template as a guide to define each task in your CrewAI application. 
     - This template helps ensure that each task is clearly defined, actionable, and aligned with the specific goals of your project.
